# BikeSharing
#### *Created a story and multiple dashboards to analyze and visualize citi bikes data using Tableau and Python*

## Overview
This project consisted on creating a pitch for a citi bike (bikesharing) business proposal for angel investors looking to seed fund. The goal was to look at citi bike data in New York City on the month of august to look how this bikesharing business operates in its prime during summer. After analyzing the data and cleaning it up a bit, I then created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities it would have in other cities.
