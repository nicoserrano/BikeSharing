# BikeSharing
#### *Created a story and multiple dashboards to analyze and visualize citi bikes data using Tableau and Python*

## Overview
This project consisted on creating a pitch for a citi bike (bikesharing) business proposal for angel investors looking to seed fund. The goal was to look at citi bike data in New York City on the month of august to look how this bikesharing business operates in its prime during summer. After analyzing the data and cleaning it up a bit, I then created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities it would have in other cities.

During august, the most profitable month of the year, the most popular hours in which people used the bikes were 5 and 6 pm during the afternoon and 8 am during the morning. This uncovers the trend that people usually use it to mobilize to and from their jobs as the peak hours are before and after work time.

Moreover, this heatmap supports this theory as it displays how the most heated and popular times are 8am and 5-6 pm during workdays. It provides additional information such as that thursday is the most popular day of the week, and that saturday and sundays' afternoons are also very popular for bikesharing.
